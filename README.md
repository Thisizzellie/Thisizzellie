# GitHub Contribution Snake Animation

![snake gif](https://github.com/Thisizzellie/Thisizzellie/blob/output/github-contribution-grid-snake.svg)

This repository contains the workflow configuration for generating a snake animation of my GitHub contribution graph.

## How it Works
- Uses GitHub Actions to generate a snake animation of my contribution graph
- Runs automatically every day at midnight
- The workflow generates a new SVG image of the snake animation
- The image is automatically pushed to the `output` branch

## Credits
- Snake animation generated using [Platane/snk](https://github.com/Platane/snk)
