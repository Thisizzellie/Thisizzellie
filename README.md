AI Engineering

CreatingAI is my parent company and R and D studio for building responsible AI products that are efficient, reliable, and usable by real teams. CreatingAI is also where I run selective consultancy and build proofs of concept for clients who need rapid execution and clarity. The long term mission is to help organisations adopt AI safely, reduce wasted spend, and raise the bar for trustworthy AI delivery.

Indie Project to suppost Full stack Development

Snapshots is a lightweight tool that helps you generate app store ready screenshots quickly without the pain of juggling multiple simulators and emulator setups. I built it because launching different phone sizes on the simulator and Android emulator was time consuming, and it also ate up computer space. The tool is designed to keep the workflow simple: take your screenshot, resize and crop cleanly, and get outputs that match the formats you need. The focus is speed, ease of use, and practical results, especially for indie builders who want to ship. It is a small product, but it saves real hours during launch week.
